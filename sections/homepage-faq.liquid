    {% assign faqs = 
      "
      What if I'm not sure how to describe what I want?||
      You don't need musical language or a fully formed concept — that's what my process is for.
      <br><br>
      A short questionnaire and a guided chat help me understand the person, story, and emotion behind the song.
      <br><br>
      From there, I translate your answers into a clear creative direction so you never feel responsible for 'directing' the music.

      ---
      How do you make sure the first version is right?||
      Most of the work happens before I start composing.
      <br><br>
      The survey, our conversation, and any reference points you share give me a strong sense of tone, pacing, and emotional arc.
      <br><br>
      I treat the first version as a finished piece — not a draft — so when you hear it, it should feel intentional, polished, and true to what you shared.

      ---
      What happens if the creative direction doesn't feel right?||
      If the song feels emotionally off — the vibe, energy, or tone isn't matching your vision — we talk about what feels misaligned.
      <br><br>
      I don't offer endless tiny technical edits. Instead, I focus on meaningful creative alignment, shifting the mood or direction so the piece feels honest and expressive.
      <br><br>
      The goal is clarity and emotional truth, not mechanical tweaking.

      ---
      Can I request changes?||
      Yes — when the changes are meaningful.
      <br><br>
      If hearing the song makes you realize the emotion or style needs to lean in a different direction, we address that thoughtfully.
      <br><br>
      I don't provide mix-by-mix or engineering revisions, but I absolutely welcome feedback that helps bring the artistic direction into clearer focus.

      ---
      Who owns the rights to my song?||
      You receive broad permission to use and share your commissioned song in any normal personal or creative context — including posting online, playing it at events, or sharing it with friends and family.
      <br><br>
      I don't resell your commissioned piece, and anything personal you share with me always remains yours.
      <br><br>
      I create each piece using my own writing and direction, supported by professional digital production tools. Because different platforms have evolving terms, I don't make legal guarantees for large-scale commercial uses like national advertising, film/TV placements, or major-label releases.
      <br><br>
      For everyday personal and online use, you're fully covered. If you ever plan a major commercial release, I'm happy to provide documentation of my creative role so you (or your legal advisor) can confirm everything aligns with current guidelines.
      <br><br>
      I reserve the right to use short excerpts of the work in my portfolio or marketing unless you request complete privacy.

      ---
      Will the song feel artificial because AI is involved?||
      AI is simply the instrument used to perform and render the music — not the author.
      <br><br>
      I write the lyrics, shape the melody, define the emotional tone, and guide how the performance should feel.
      <br><br>
      The technology helps produce the final delivery, but the meaning, structure, and creative decisions behind the song are fully human.
      <br><br>
      The finished piece should feel personal, expressive, and emotionally grounded — not artificial or generic.

      ---
      What is your refund policy?||
      I want the experience to feel fair, transparent, and comfortable.
      <br><br>
      Because each song is handcrafted and tailored to your story, the refund structure follows the natural checkpoints of the creative process:
      <br><br>
      <strong>• Before final lyric approval:</strong> Full refund — no questions asked.<br>
      <strong>• After lyric approval but before the first musical rendering:</strong> 50% refund.<br>
      <strong>• After the first musical rendering:</strong> 25% refund.<br>
      <strong>• After the second musical edit:</strong> The work is considered complete and non-refundable.<br><br>
      These stages protect you without locking you in, and I always encourage early communication so we can address any misalignment as soon as it appears.
