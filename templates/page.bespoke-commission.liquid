                            My name is Jeff Holste. My background—from the stages of Lincoln Center to a teaching lineage tracing back to Beethoven—taught me more than just mastery of the piano. It taught me how to listen.

                            To hear the emotion inside a story and translate it into sound. That truth transcends genre. Whether your vision calls for a cinematic orchestra, a modern pop arrangement, or a soulful acoustic track, the foundation is always the same.

                            AI is simply the instrument used to perform and render the music — not the author. I write the lyrics, 
                            shape the melody, define the emotional tone, and guide how the performance should feel. The technology helps 
                            produce the final delivery, but the meaning, structure, and creative decisions behind the song are fully human. 
                            The finished piece should feel personal, expressive, and emotionally grounded — not artificial or generic.
